    <div class="intro">
      <p>For our project, we chose to prototype a startup called Clover. Clover is essentially a text editor, similar to popular editors like Microsoft Word and Google Docs. One main differentiating feature that
        Clover emphasizes is the ability to edit documents in “infinite canvas” mode, as opposed to a restricted page editor. Clover also aims to integrate file sharing, syncing with a calendar, and allowing drawing
        tools. For our prototype, we attempted to best capture these main features.

    <div class="original">
    <p>The first step that we took in our design process was to brainstorm 4 different possible designs for your startup’s app.</p>

    <p>The initial sketches reflect a variety of layouts and interactions for the key functionalities of the app.</p>
    </div>

    <h1 class="lowfi">WireFrame</h1>
    <div class="div1">
      <p>We found that each of our sketches, while conveying our general ideas on the full site, honed in on a specific (and different) feature of the app. One of us had a heavy focus on the home page, one on the calendar feature,
        one on the editor itself, and one on the zooming feature of Canvas mode. Thus, we decided to combine these functionalities together, adding to our product the feature we each focused on while also creating a unifying theme
         for our app. We worked together on the means of navigating through the app, so that we could create lo-fi wireframes of the app and translate them seamlessly into high-fidelity prototypes.
       <br>Here are a few screenshots of our low-fi wireframes.</p></p>

    <h1 class="highfi">Interactive Hi-Fi Mockup</h1>
    <div class="div2">
      <p>After completing the wireframe, we continued on designing our first interactive hi-fi mockup. We created several extra pages to illustrate the functionality of switching between drawing, typing and selecting, and the
         difference between page mode and canvas mode. We also design a few more pages for the feature of zooming in/out of the images.
       <br>Here are the screenshots of a few pages from our first interactive hi-fi that are different in the later versions.</p>

       </div>
      <p>During the studio, we received some useful feedback and critiques for our hi-fi, and we made some important changes to our design after the studio.</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="ans"> We added labels to sidebar icons to clarify meanings as users had difficulty interpreting the meaning of a few of the buttons - namely the size up/down buttons, which were perceived to be eraser tools.  </li>
        <li class="ans"> We moved the plus sign to add documents on the bottom left of home, replacing the larger logo as users found the large logo at the bottom corner to be somewhat jarring, stating that they would have expected a more central function to be located there. </li>
        <li class="ans"> We shifted functionality of sidebar on Home page to allow redirect back to Home as users pointed out that this seemed somewhat redundant and unexpected, as they were expecting to be led to another page.</li>
        <li class="ans"> We switched icons for page view and canvas view so the option for the alternate view showed up in the editor as users mentioned that having the icon contrast from the view mode signalled to the them that
          clicking the button will change their view mode and they found it more intuitive to display the icon of the alternate view mode.</li>
        <li class="ans"> We edited the transition between the two view modes as users expressed some confusion with not knowing if they were in Page mode or Canvas mode.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After working on these post-studio edits, we finished the second version of our interactive hi-fi. (Click on the image to navigate to the prototype)</p>

    <h1 class="usertesting">User Testing</h1>
    <div class="div3">
      <h2> Scenario </h2>
      <p>We proceeded to do a user testing for our revised prototype, We first designed a scenario for our user:
        <br><br>Clover is a text editor with advanced features, including the ability to toggle between “Page” and “Canvas” mode. Canvas mode is an “infinite” canvas without the restrictions of a page.
        <br>Imagine you are a student taking notes in class called CS18. You would like to record your handwritten notes in your favorite text editor, Clover.
        <br>For the task, we want you to simulate the experience of opening the notebook by: navigating to your notebook for CS18, toggling on the drawing tool, and toggling the editor into Canvas mode.</p>
      <h2> Subtasks </h2>
      <p>In order to let our users better understand the goal and the task, we designed some instructions and splitted the task into a few subtasks: </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="ans"> Open a new notebook in Clover and toggle to the typing tool.  </li>
          <li class="ans"> Return to home and navigate to your notebook entitled "CS18 Notebook". Toggle into canvas mode and toggle to the select tool.</li>
          <li class="ans"> On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being easy and 10 being difficult, how would you rate your ability to find the controls to toggle between view modes? Between tools? [Verbal Response] </li>
          <li class="ans"> Toggle to the drawing tool while still in Canvas mode. Zoom into the diagram on the page by navigating to the zoom dropdown, clicking "Custom Zoom" and selecting the cursor arrow that appears on screen.
            (This interaction would be a drag-to-zoom feature on the actual interface, but the limitations of our prototyping tool did not allow for this.) </li>
          <li class="ans"> Use "zoom to fit" to zoom out of this screen. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Post-Test Questions </h2>
        <p>We also set up a few post-test questions to help us better understand how our users feel during the test.</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="ans">What frustrated you most about this site? What was clear about this site?</li>
          <li class="ans">We indicated during one of the tasks that we wanted to implement a custom zoom feature that would allow a user to drag across a section in Canvas mode to zoom into. Is this a feature you could see yourself using?</li>
          <li class="ans">How likely are you to recommend this site to a friend or colleague (0=Not at all likely, and 10=Very Likely)?</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h1 class="result">Results & Analysis</h1>
    <div class="div4">
      <p>We soon received the results of three user testings.</p>

      <div style = "margin-left: 80px;">
        <video class="videoresponse" height="230" style="vertical-align:top;" controls>

        <figcaption style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 180px;">Videos of users testing our prototype.</figcaption>
      </div>
      <h2> Observed Errors </h2>
      <p> Some of them get stuck on certain steps, which lead them to stop and can not proceed to the following steps, and there are also some other errors that we observed, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="ans">Keeps clicking around but can not find the zoom in/out button, and thus he gets stuck when running across info that is unclear or too small.</li>
        <li class="ans">Toggles do not indicate the current mode and the mode user would be toggling to.</li>
        <li class="ans">This user could not find the specific zoom feature but there are some other options relating to sizing.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2> Implication of Results </h2>
      <p>Addressing the tasks given, we can interpret the results so that we can, hopefully, make improvements on subsequent iterations of the prototype. First, for our task of opening up the notebook and toggling on the specified settings,
         some users expressed confusion with the toggling mechanisms. One user indicated that it was sometimes unclear what state the editor was in having toggled a button. Conversely, another user indicated that the buttons are clear.
         The reactions of both users somewhat align with our expectations. We attempted to make the functions of the button as clear as possible by using both icons and labels, and one user reaffirms this. However,  we also anticipated that
         the states of the editor would be clear because of the icon, but to one user this was not the case.
       <br><br>For the subtask of zooming, most of our users indicated that they would use our “custom zoom” feature for zooming on Canvas mode. They explain that they could see this being helpful. Conversely, one user indicates that,
       because of the “dual viewing” modes, the custom zoom may be unnecessary. For the most part, these responses align with expectations. We expected that users would find this custom zoom useful on an infinite canvas editor layout,
       and they indicated as much. Some users struggled using the zooming feature because our custom zoom was only enabled for a specific mode, so the feature was not always accessible across all modes.</p>
       <h2> Potential Interface Change </h2>
       <p> One potential change would be to more clearly indicate the state of the editor, as users complained that it wasn’t always clear. We could do this by showing a temporary pop up notification of the current mode. Another change
         would be to allow the custom zoom for all modes (text, draw, etc) as this was a point of confusion. (also maybe labeling the zoom button - we assumed the function of the percent with a carrot going down would be clear but ig not)</p>
